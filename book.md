format
organization of data
and then infinite stream of R.W.R.R.W.R.R random read/writes

Writes
Can always be sequential, but is about availability trade-off. how long does it take to update read paths for Read/Write consistency?

Reads
indexes are a (sorted data) space vs time trade-off based off of structure of data
caches are a space vs time trade-off based off of order of data acesss

here we can know about read patterns by supply machine

type system is just values and changes


# Session Types

explain machines

combined with monads


# Diffs & Checkpoints

only values and changes. types are just non-determinstic changes
