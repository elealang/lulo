# use cases

## creating and storing data

create separate library to define binary format for data types

## defining schemas over that data

type checking of data
html generation

## deriving transformers from one type to another

the type of the data explains how to get from A to B?

## tracking all changes in your data (VCS)

built-in vcs capabilities, especially if code is lulo data

## registers

a register is just value and changes 
register is type?

# plan

make lulo fully capable as a "manual" programming language
elea adds on reactive, state machine, orchestration layer 
but without it, you can still add/move data manually
including creating transformers
build applications but where things have to be moved manually
emphasize distinction between data and control flow layer
