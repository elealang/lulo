# A New Kind of Language


Think about ETL and data platforms. what do we really need?

a language for data. can be an IDL, but also completely indepedent.

orthoganizal to normal prog language because we can separate data 
and control flow layer


monads? registers with side effects?


### what it's not?

it cannot do any automatic flow, e.g. loops
but it does come with a basic control flow engine similar jinja templates.
